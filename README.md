=======

A toolkit for analyzing Polaris MD trajectories written in python.

## File conversion ##
The first step in using this toolkit is take \*.xvg files that are generated by Polaris and convert them to \*.h5 database files. The \*h5 files are used as input for other programs in this toolkit.

## About Polaris ##
